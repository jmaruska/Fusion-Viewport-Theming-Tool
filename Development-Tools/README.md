# Autodesk Color Developer Tools

This folder contains two web-based tools for Autodesk color development and inspection:

---

## 1. Autodesk XML Visualizer

A browser-based tool for visualizing ARGB and RGBA color tokens from Autodesk XML files.
- Instantly parses and displays all color tokens with swatches and compositing previews.
- Useful for inspecting and understanding color usage in Autodesk configuration files.
- See `autodesk-xml-visualizer/README.md` for full details and usage instructions.

---

## 2. Autodesk HIG Palette Table

A static HTML table listing the Autodesk Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) palette colors.
- Shows color names, swatches, hex values, and normalized RGB values (0–1).
- Useful as a reference for Autodesk’s official UI color palette.
- See comments in `Autodesk-ColorTables.html` for more information.

Each tool is self-contained and can be opened directly in a modern web browser.  
For more details, refer to the individual `README.md` files in each tool’s folder.
